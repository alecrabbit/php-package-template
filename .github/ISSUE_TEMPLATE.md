Hello,

I encountered an issue with the following code:
```php
// code
```
Library version: **PUT HERE YOUR COMPOSER LIBRARY VERSION**
> use the command `composer show alecrrabbit/<lib>`

PHP version: **PUT HERE YOUR PHP VERSION**
> use the command `php -v` or code `echo phpversion();`

I expected to get:
```
6
```
<!--

But I actually get:
```
5
```
Thanks!
